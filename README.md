# f/π

As technology and digital photography have changed the work done by
photographers, they now hold libraries with thousands of images, videos
and files that need to be catalogued, tagged, searched and published.

Image organizer software improves a photographer workflow by providing
the means to manage a large number of images.  They resemble the more
complex Digital Asset Management (DAM) systems, often used with larger
and broader amount of digital media. With little changes, this class of
of software can support video and audio, along with images, providing a
simple and flexible workflow with complete support for the type of media
produced by photographers.

Currently, there are simple and powerful tools for Microsoft's Windows
and Apple's macOS, and although there are several tools for the Linux
Operating System, these tools are either too limited, or too complex.

The goal of this project is to build a tool focused on photographers,
who currently need to manage, not only digital image files, but also
video and audio. The software will be developed for the Linux operating
system, but should use portable tools so that it can be used on other
platforms such as Windows and macOS.

## Objectives

f/π is a Media Organizer tool focused on photography, but designed to
support both video and audio files.

### Goals

f/π will have support for:

- Catalog based media management, allowing management of offline files.
- Multiple storage units, be it local, network or cloud storage.
- International metadata standards, such as EXIF, IPTC and XMP.
- Image tagging with hierarchical keywords, labels, ratings and
  selection attributes.
- Multiple operating systems, such as Linux, macOS and Windows.

## Requirements

f/π requires a few Python modules, can be found on
[requirements.txt](requirements.txt), and [Phil Harvey's ExifTool].

## Contributing to the project

Yes, money is accepted. ;-)

But we are much more in need of code, and testing, and documentation. So
if you think you can contribute to the project (only using is a valid
contribution), check out [Contributing](docs/Contributing.md).
